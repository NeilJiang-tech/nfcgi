nfcgi is a FastCGI protocol library in a single file (with 2 headers).

This runs at least on macOS and FreeBSD, likely also on any Linux distro (possibly needs libbsd)

I wrote this in a weekend, it's in standard C with no external deps, should be pretty easy to include in other projects.

Here, I handle some of the request bookkeeping on top of the base protocol. You could probably multithread overtop of it, and I might try with the project I made this for.

This library is smaller than the reference implementation, and offers more features in some regards (less in others).
I decided to go with less weird things like piping stdout, stdin, stderr directly to the remote, and give more direct control over each request to the user.
